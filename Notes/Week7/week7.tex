\chapter{Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution}
\section{Office Hours (Salinas)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{2/21:}Setup drawings points for Eucalyptus Oil and Bromination of Vanillin notebook pages? No new glassware setups so no drawings needed, right?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Nope, not needed --- we can just refer back.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Go over Eucalyptus Oil reagent table column entries; make sure I have everything I need.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Any hydrocarbon component.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Crude yield and percent recovery calculations?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I did them correctly.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Do we not need an entry for one of the substances this week? Perhaps \ce{EtOH} in \ce{H2O}? Since there are only 15 points on Canvas, that leads me to think you're only looking for 5 entries.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Do all six reagents.
        \item Just treat $50\%$ \ce{EtOH} in \ce{H2O} as \ce{EtOH} (though there might be slight safety differences; check to make sure there isn't a separate MSDS for \ce{EtOH} in \ce{H2O}).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\section{Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{2/22:}Office hours Wednesday/Thursday at 4:00 PM.
    \item 1 page notes sheet for the exam next week.
    \item Alkyl groups activate aromatic rings via induction.
    \item Halogens.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Electron-withdrawing due to induction.
        \item Unlike alkyl groups, however, they have lone pairs that can contribute to resonance once the electrophile is added (i.e., in the carbocation intermediate).
        \item Halogens with greater electronegativity are more strongly electron-withdrawing and thus more deactivating.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Two major problems:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Predicting the products based off of the substituents present on a ring.
        \item Synthesizing a ring with multiple substituents on it (the order you add them matters!).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Practice problem takeaways.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When you have an ortho/para-directing substituent, you don't have to indicate major/minor products.
        \item However, when doing a synthesis, try and make the reaction more selective by precluding one of the sites with another functional group. You could synthesize ortho/para products and then purify (throw away half of your yield), and while this is an acceptable answer, it is not the best answer when there are other options.
        \item $t$-butyl groups generate significant steric hindrance, so groups will avoid adding ortho to them (even though $t$-butyl is an ortho/para-director by induction).
        \item We will not see trick questions where something is so deactivating that we don't have a reaction; in these cases in reality, raising the temperature would suffice to force the reaction.
        \item Resonance donation outcompetes induction donation.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Rules.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If all substituents direct to the same place, EAS happens there.
        \item If not, the strongest \emph{activator} wins.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This is because deactivators slow everything down (but just the meta site less) whereas activators specifically accelerate particular sites.
        \end{itemize}
        \item If one site is significantly more crowded than a second (out of two choices), sterics can play a role.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item You do need a really big $t$-butyl group (or something larger) though to see this effect.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Synthesis practice problem.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Benzene to 3-bromoaniline.
        \item Preferentially use \ce{H2 + Pd/C} to form an amine from a nitro group. The others are less common.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nucleophilic aromatic substitution}. \emph{Also known as} \textbf{NAS}, \textbf{S\textsubscript{N}Ar}.
    \item Reacting various aromatic compounds with methoxide and methanol.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Chlorobenzene: No reaction.
        \item para-chloronitrobenzene: The methoxide substitutes the chloride (at high temperatures).
        \item 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene: The methoxide substitutes the chloride (much faster at lower temperatures).
        \item meta-chloronitrobenzene: No reaction.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Mechanism.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The driving force for the reaction is having the better leaving group leave.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Between methoxide and chloride, for example, chloride is the better LG.
        \end{itemize}
        \item To form the Meisenheimer complex, you need a strongly electron-withdrawing group (such as a nitro group) or an intramolecular kinetic driving force.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item You also need the EWG in the right position to be able to accept electron density through resonance.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Meisenheimer complex}: The intermediate with a double-bonded nitrogen in a nitrobenzene derivative undergoing S\textsubscript{N}Ar.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can be isolated at very low temperatures.
    \end{itemize}
    \item 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene becomes 2-chloro-1-methoxy-4-nitrobenzene due to the para-activation of the nitro group.
    \item Reduction of aromatic compounds.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Useful when you want to create a cyclohexane derivative --- you can put on functional groups with EAS and NAS, and then reduce at the end.
    \end{itemize}
    \item High pressure catalyzed.
    \item General form.

    \begin{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item When we radiolabel the carbon to which bromine is initially bonded, we see that two products are formed in equimolar ratios.
        \item This means that something other than S\textsubscript{N}Ar is occurring, and that whatever is happening is proceeding through some sort of symmetric intermediate.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item With a strong enough base, we can formally abstract a hydrogen from benzene to create an alkyne-like species.
        \item Orbitally, we can picture the triple bond in benzyne as a weak interaction (weak because of the nonlinearity/intense angle strain) between adjacent $p$ orbitals in the molecular plane.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Applications of this reaction and further mechanistic evidence.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Using the strong base \ce{KNH2}, we can generate the benzyne intermediate and then trap it with other nucleophiles, leading to an equimolar mixture of products.
        \item We can also trap benzyne by using it as the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction.
        \item Lastly, we note that 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene does not react under these conditions, confirming the need for an $\alpha$-proton to make the benzyne intermediate.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
