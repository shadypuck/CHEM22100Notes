\chapter{Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution}
\section{Office Hours (Salinas)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{2/21:}Setup drawings points for Eucalyptus Oil and Bromination of Vanillin notebook pages? No new glassware setups so no drawings needed, right?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Nope, not needed --- we can just refer back.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Go over Eucalyptus Oil reagent table column entries; make sure I have everything I need.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Any hydrocarbon component.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Crude yield and percent recovery calculations?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I did them correctly.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Do we not need an entry for one of the substances this week? Perhaps \ce{EtOH} in \ce{H2O}? Since there are only 15 points on Canvas, that leads me to think you're only looking for 5 entries.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Do all six reagents.
        \item Just treat $50\%$ \ce{EtOH} in \ce{H2O} as \ce{EtOH} (though there might be slight safety differences; check to make sure there isn't a separate MSDS for \ce{EtOH} in \ce{H2O}).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
